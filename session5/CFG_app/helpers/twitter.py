This script contains the necessary functions to query the Twitter API and
return lists containing the tweets data.
The queries are done using Tweepy, a Python library for Twitter's API
In this case we are not using callback urls to request explicit permission
of the user although this could be adopted easily.
The functions to do this can be found in: helpers/twitter_auth.py
Note that in order to use the various functions here you have to authenticate first
